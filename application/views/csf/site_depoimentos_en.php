			If I could give one piece of advice to anyone who is in doubt between being an exchange student or not, I would say: Just go! Let go of your fears and insecurities because there is an incredible world out there just waiting for you. I got here without speaking English very well, so I took a 6-month English course. Easy? NO! Those who got here with a good English basis found it much easier, so I advise you to study hard and try to learn as much as possible before you leave. The best universities ask for super high TOEFL grades, here at UCSD we completed a 20-week course to get 90 in the TOEFL iBT, and those who are familiar with the difficulty level of the test know that it is not easy to achieve this score in such a short time. Here in the United States, mainly in California, there are people from all corners of the world, and when I say everyone, I mean everyone! I met Japanese people, Chinese people, Koreans, Arabs, Indians, Turks, Germans, Americans, Swiss people, Italians, French people, Egyptians, Norwegians, people from Kuwait, and from countries that I didn't even know existed. I learned a lot with this experience, I had to adapt not only to the American culture, but to cultures that are completely different from my own, like the Arabic culture for instance. It wasn't easy at first, but eventually we realized we are all different anyway and that respecting the opinion and views of others is paramount.
		</p>
		<p>
			And the most important, the classes and the university: you can choose the subjects that you´ve always wanted to do!
			That's what I did in this case, or you can try a course to eliminate from your curricula in the Brazilian University.
			The professors are great, I had the honour of having class with a professor who had received a Nobel Prize and many other
			awards, including from the hands of President Obama. I chose to study neuroscience, considering I did not have the chance
			to study that in Brazil. The classes are not easy, and I had to study really hard. Also, the grades here are a little different;
			if you get 74, it means you got a C and did not pass the international students programme of the UC (it is considered a
			low grade, but you would have passed if you were a normal student).
			If you get 85 (B), you are considered an "average" student.
			To get a good grade, you have to get 94 or over (A or A +).

			"I´ve always dreamed of being an exchange student! And I can say that my experience in the United States exceeded my
			expectations! I was part of research groups in my area, and worked on topics I would probably not have had access to
			in undergraduate level in Brazil. I managed to complete a summer internship at a laboratory inside the Kent State University.
			I also had contact with people of different cultures, not just the American culture. In addition to all the academic events
			I participated in (Symposia, International Congress, etc.), I had the opportunity to take trips with the university itself,
			such as travelling and skiing. I also stayed with a host family, which helped me understand a little more about the local culture.
			It was definitely a unique opportunity! And if I could, I would do it again! "

			"It is really difficult to describe the most incredible experiences of my exchange in Australia, since each day I was there
			was always a new adventure or challenge. From adapting to the new environment, new customs and new people to the farewell of
			friends and colleagues, I encountered many situations I would never have experienced in Brazil, like living with an Australian
			family and having to "learn" to eat noodles every day, make more Asian friends than Australians even though I was in Australia,
			find out that kangaroos aren´t running around loose on the city streets and that a koala is the cutest animal I've ever seen.
			I can also say that the new knowledge I acquired in an Australian university helped me grow both personally and professionally.
			Anyway, it's a privilege to be able to apply and share everything I've learned in a year and a half outside my country.
			So it is with great pride that I say: I am a former scholarship student of Science without Borders."

			"I would definitely do another exchange. The experience abroad was very valuable. In Brazil I live with my parents, so the experience of living alone and of having new responsibilities was very interesting. In my case, I lived with lots of other Brazilians in Newcastle, since my scholarship programme had around 100 Brazilians. There were lots of positive and some negative points, too. In the beginning especially, it´s always good to have Brazilians around and it helps with the adaptation, but it also helps to make foreign friends to learn about different cultures and customs, and to improve your language skills. While I was abroad I thought my English had not improved much, but after doing the IELTS and returning to Brazil, I felt a positive difference. Now, it´s much easier to read articles and the fear I had in relation to English is gone. I made some friends in AU, but I see it's really difficult to keep in touch, on the other hand, the Brazilians I met there, we still talk a lot and we´ve already planned future trips; I even met students of medicine of the PUC I had never spoken to in Brazil and we became friends in AU. In relation to the programme, I think it is a great opportunity to learn about other cultures and it is fully accessible to all students. However, regarding medicine, it could have been better, since in academic terms, I had higher expectations. I hear lots of my colleagues saying they would not do an exchange because they don´t want to delay a year of college, but I don't regret having ?delayed? a year and a half of college. Besides the chance to get to know new places, new people and make new friends, the experiences I've had abroad will be unforgettable and definitely contributed a lot to my training, since a professional is not a technician, but a combination of all his or her personal and academic knowledge."

The chance to have classes, study subjects that are not part of the university curriculum in Brazil (but that will enrich my training), to experience and adapt to a new educational system and to do an internship with renowned scholars made me ponder on the decisions that will affect my future and gave me the chance to be positively influenced by these professionals."

			"The exchange is a whole new year in the life of students. The experiences are unique, the seconds are memorable and the people that we meet are unforgettable. Everything helps make the time that the student spends away from home the best experience ever. Exchange is a time of self-discovery and discovery of new cultures. My year from July 2014 to July 2015 was one of those incredible moments of my life. It's really funny how different each exchange is. This was my third exchange but I feel as if it were the first. Everything is different in a university exchange, and this time the focus was much more professional, with goals for the not-so-distant future. This time, I was aware of my duties and of what I would like to plant and reap in the future. I met a lot of good people, I learned even more about the German culture and improved the language. But above all, this exchange will make a lot of difference in my academic and professional life. In the first half of this year in Germany I decided to go to college. I did as many subjects as I could, invested all my time in my studies, trips and making new friends.  I took advantage of every second to make this the best possible experience. And it?s really worth it. In all the subjects, I visited incredible places and met wonderful people that I will never forget. I returned from each field trip feeling more motivated and thinking how lucky I was to have seen everything I saw. In the second semester, I focused on an internship. I did not rest until I took advantage of all the opportunities, after all, an internship abroad is a curriculum upgrade and it is considered a valuable learning experience. Besides, the main goal of Science without Borders is to import knowledge that will help Brazil grow. With that idea in mind, I pursued the scholarship and got it.  My internship was at the third largest research institute in Germany, the Helmholtz-Zentrum, where I had the chance to do research on hydrogen as a renewable energy. In addition to familiarizing myself with the German work style, conducting practical and theoretical research, and having my name in an article that will be published in an international journal, I used the internship as the topic of my completion of course work (I even started writing it during the work intervals). Based on the entire experience, today I know that opportunities are always available, you just have to pursue them and not give up. My exchange made me grow a lot in every way, I will never forget this experience and I know I will soon reap the results. The effort really paid off, because above all (lessons, internship, trips, new friends, learning), I'm going to finish the year knowing I was very happy."

			"During my exchange experience with Science without Borders, I lived in two different cities in Germany because my scholarship offer included a 6-month language course plus a year of college.  The first city where I had my first overseas experience was Marburg, state of Hessen, in the centre of Germany, near Frankfurt. An incredibly entertaining city, marked by the passage of the Grimm Brothers, who lived there and filled the city with sculptures and monuments that resemble the characters of their stories and fables. Then there was the city´s landmark: Marburg Castle. Located at the top of the mountain, you can see it from all the points of the city - all you have to do is look up - and the night lighting enhances the magic of the population of just over 80 thousand inhabitants. There I studied at the language school Speak and Write, with extremely competent and attentive professionals, and in 6 months I managed to advance from level A1 to B2, with TELC certification, that qualified me to enter college. I was then selected to study at the Technische Hochschule Deggendorf (University of Applied Sciences of Deggendorf) in the city of Deggendorf, in Bavaria, south of the country. This university city of approximately 40 thousand inhabitants, did not contemplate medieval scenarios like Marburg, but it was the portrait of the Bavarian culture, customs and dialects that impressed us so much, in addition to the natural heritage from the Danube River - Die Donau, in German - the second longest river in Europe, and the Bayerischer Wald -Bavarian Forests - full of animals that are specific of the region and sometimes seem exotic to us, who come from another continent. The ideal environment to live a quality life and grow academically, the THD (term commonly used there to refer to the university - the abbreviated name in German) is a relatively new university, but it is already considered a benchmark in many fields of knowledge. The courses the university offers are mostly in the fields of engineering and exact sciences, but they also have tourism and foreign trade, that normally receive the highest number of foreign students. The university offers a quality infrastructure, with rooms equipped with cutting-edge multimedia resources to help professors and students. Considering that 90% of German colleges are public, at no cost for students, they offer excellent education with renowned and experienced professors. However, not everything is easy, as we all know. The Germans are famous for being reserved and closed, and when it comes to studying, you can´t expect much ?attention? from people, because they dedicate themselves completely to their studies and adopt the ?doesn?t know, I´ll do it? policy without much room for excuses. They assume the responsibility and solve the problem, without losing respect, of course. But that is only the case of work and study, because in all the other situations they are very receptive and ready for a good conversation, get-together or party. I say this because I lived in a fraternity with 2 Germans, and I was the only Brazilian student. Anyway, the THD was a great choice to grow academically, and with dedication you can do all the assignments and exams in German. So for me, as a life and academic experience, it was really unique. In 1.5 years, I had direct and indirect contact with approximately 500 new people, among Brazilians and foreigners, which allowed me to learn new cultures and relearn the Brazilian culture, which is huge and amazing. So, I recommend the programme without a doubt, preferably to students who have already completed half of their course in Brazil so they can benefit more from the specific parts of the course, which is the most distinctive aspect of learning abroad."

In addition to all this, I could still travel on my holidays and visit fantastic places like Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, Singapore and Indonesia.

Since I enrolled in the exchange programme, I knew what I was willing to go through, not only because of the time away from home, but for the new cultural diversity. The experience of living in a first world country is fundamental if we want our Brazil one day be regarded as such. I'm grateful for the experiences I had, that somehow helped me grow, like the contact with a highly educated population, improving my English, living with people from different countries, and the friends I made here, from all of Brazil, that I'll never forget. I was also able to verify that the infrastructure and quality of the programmes is the same at our college, in comparison with the campus where I am studying. In relation to the entertainment, it's everywhere; all you have to do it manage your time to get to know the customs, sports, sights, that are numerous, and what people do for leisure and fun. You always end up feeling a little homesick and sad, and it´s just part of everyday life, but it doesn?t last long and it happens anywhere, at any distance."

To experience the Canadian culture showed me how culturally outdated Brazil is, where there - a first world country - education is considered essential for any professionals of any area. Anyway, the chance to do the SwB exchange allowed me to experience the culture of the country, which helps students get more involved because the programme has an internship/research period where you must create and deliver results and, particularly in my case, create equipment and devices for prostate cancer treatment by using a new method - HIFU (High Intensity Focused Ultrasound), a non-invasive treatment that is as efficient as traditional methods.

I learned a foreign language, confronted my fears and won. A new world unfolded before me and opened my mind, there are no more limits, no more paradigms, no more prejudgments. My contact with foreigners, and that includes Brazilians from other regions, shows that the universe of diversity is huge and we must respect it and be curious to confront it, leave our comfort zone and enjoy the opportunities."

			"There are no words to describe the feeling before you get on that plane, but the 11 hours flew passed (literally), and a few hours later, I was there, about to experience some of the best moments of my life. I can't limit my exchange experience in Science without Borders to an academic experience; this year was a lot more, far beyond anything I imagined. The exchange gives us the opportunity to go to entirely new places, meet different people and explore different cultures; an exchange is the best way to live, to truly live, experience the world around us in an independent and unique way. If I would do another exchange? Yes, just tell me the time and date and I´ll go running."

			"The best experience during the exchange was learning about new cultures. When I decided to be an exchange student and after choosing the destination country, I wanted to have experiences I would never have in Brazil, so I decided on a homestay. In addition to learning about the North American culture, I learned a lot about the Jewish culture due to the host family; they adopted me as a member of their family, they let me participate as a member of their family.  Another cool experience I had were related to the customs and cultures of the population and the climate of the country. Toronto is known all over the world as a multicultural city, so it was quite normal to sit inside the subway and hear different languages. The faculty life was totally different from what I´m used to in Brazil, entirely different methodologies and different academic styles, the professors have a colder relationship with the students; asking questions, raising your hand and asking, does not exist.

			"As I lived in one of the university residences, I had the chance to learn about other cultures and customs, as well as improve my Italian. But, at one point I felt the need to learn English on my own because a lot of the people who lived there were Asians and Africans. At first, I studied in free websites, but that wasn't enough so I started using Google Translate on the phone to communicate. Although I could not speak the language, I understood what people said. I used to speak to an Italian Muslim who was the roommate of an Indian. And that´s how I started to practice my basic English; at one point I stopped translating because some phrases were repeated a lot and the Indian student and I became friends. I was introduced to other people who were friends of the Indian girl, and we eventually became really close friends. Just before I returned to Brazil, it was Ramadan, and that was the best moment of the exchange experience, since most of my friends were Muslims. They ate and drank from sunset to sunrise and on countless days we went to sleep at 7:00 in the morning, after playing, chatting, drinking bottles of water and eating all night.  I would definitely do it again. The next opportunity will be for my future specialization.""

			"During the SwB exchange, I learned a lot, made friends for life, visited new places and had unique experiences. After living a year in Finland, I learned Finnish and experienced the local culture; both of which are completely different from anything we have in Brazil. There, we also live with people of many different nationalities - Finns, Russians, Poles, Iranians, Nepalese, Chinese, Germans, Italians and others - each with their particular customs and viewpoints, enriching my vision of right and wrong. At the University, I could expand my knowledge with the subjects that are taught here. To top it off, during that year, I was able to witness an Aurora Borealis (pictured), a rare and wonderful phenomenon that only happens in the northernmost regions of the planet."

			"My exchange at Aalto University in Helsinki, Finland, was full of incredible experiences. Living with people of different nationalities and cultures, the opportunity to take courses in several areas within the field of engineering and the technical visits afforded me a great learning experience, memories and friends for life. As one of the most striking moments, I will never forget the excursion where I spent the night accompanying the operations in the navigating bridge of an ice-breaker. And when we visited a cruise ship under construction and presented our work at the ship yard responsible for the Allure of the Seas and Oasis of the Seas, the largest cruise ships in the world. Representing the university with two friends during a sustainability competition at the Technical University of Denmark was also unforgettable. On that occasion, I could choose a course in the field of mechanical engineering, offered during the three weeks leading up to the competition. There, we had a closer contact with the local life and yet another unique university environment. These experiences, combined with the organization, culture and values of the Finnish people, made my exchange memorable."

When I got there, I felt at home almost immediately because I was lucky to meet really nice people (fellow Brazilians and Scots). Being close to London was also a big advantage because I had the chance to visit the Mozilla office and Adobe office - a chance every design student would love to have. In recent months I was really lucky to work on a research project with a professor of the university who was Director of IDEO London. All these experiences made me feel whole and inspired me to keep going, and helped me confirm I had made the right career choice."

			"Participating in Science without Borders was, without a doubt, the most culturally enriching experience that I have ever had. In addition to the completely different academic system, it was very interesting to interact with the British and understand how their society reacts - different from Brazil - a wide variety of nationalities co-exist in all of Europe. I was as foreign as the people from Scandinavia, China, India, etc. It made me see how big and diversified the world is, much more than I ever imagined. The SwB, without a doubt, in addition to opening doors (academic, professional and cultural), also opens your mind to a world that is far more complex, rich and interesting."

			"As a medical student, my experience in the United Kingdom - where there is a wonderful public health system - was unparalleled. For a year I could work with doctors, participate in surgeries and routine tasks at the school of medicine, and know the reality of a system that serves the population really well. In addition to the practical experience, the entire academic experience was very rewarding. There, I wrote and defended my first thesis in the medical field, I learned a lot about orthopaedics (the field of the course I completed), and even about the actual process of studying. The University of Dundee was very receptive all of the time, and the city eventually became a second home, which I really miss. Visiting other places in Europe (it was my second time in the continent) was very nice, but being able to live in a small town in a country that is not so popular made all the difference. I find it impossible to live in Scotland for a period and not become a little Scottish - and proof of that is the flag that is hanging on my living room wall since I got back. Finally, I can say that it is an experience that changes your life, from being able to represent the university, as I did recently at the British Consulate, to keeping in touch with my advisor there, who talks to me through Skype and helps me plan my academic future."

			"Scotland is full of history and culture. For me this is the most significant part of my exchange experience. The Scots have a sensational cultural baggage. From ghost tours to enjoying a single malt with a view of Edinburgh Castle. My best memories include a trip to Loch Ness, hitchhiking to the city of St. Andrews, driving a car with the steering wheel on the wrong side, visiting the Highlands and the Isle of Skye, learning about Scottish history and eating haggis (a typically Scottish dish. They cook all the insides of a sheep inside its stomach. They mash it and add various spices. It´s actually pretty tasty). I had other experiences that I will never forget. I visited several countries, made friends from all over the world, went to see lots of theatre plays and got lost several times in almost every city I went to :D One of the most memorable moments was on a trip through continental Europe. I was travelling from Prague to Krakow. Along the way I needed to change trains, but I got distracted and did not get off the train at the right station. I got off at an almost deserted station. I didn't know if I was still in the Czech Republic or if I was in Poland. The cashier hardly spoke any English and she sold me a ticket to the station that I needed to go to. The only problem was that the train was leaving in 5 minutes. I rushed off and suddenly realized I didn't know where I was running to. I asked the only man that I saw and he looked at my ticket and showed me the right way. I ran off again, I tripped on the stairs, scraped myself everywhere. But I made it in time and I got into a suuuper old train. I looked a little communist. Everything was fine after that, but the butterflies came back every time I remembered that I almost got lost in a small town God knows in which country."

			"What I can say about my first impressions is that people are much more receptive than I expected. I had this preconceived idea that Americans want to be better than everyone else (which is true in some cases), but when you say you come from Brazil, I don´t know, everything changes, they want to know about our football, our food, how friendly and fun we are. To be Brazilian today IS something to be proud of. NEVER forget to say ?I am from Brazil? after saying your name. I tried it and realized the conversation becomes more laid-back. On the first days, I was impressed by everything, everything here is exaggerated, it seems that everything comes from Itu ... lol... the university buildings look like castles, the cups in the fast-food restaurants that are considered small here are extra large in Brazil, and the large cups here are family-size in Brazil. You will reeaallly miss the food, seriously, especially if you like rice, beans and steak for lunch every day. The first days will be tense, but then you get used to it. Coffee, aaaaaaah I miss our coffee, with a cheese roll... mmmmmmmmmmmm... but we have to dance to the music: I'm here and I have to get used to it. You will be overwhelmed, considering we are so exploited and so happy at the same time, clothing, electronics, cars and shoes here always seem to be on sale, but no, the tax burden here is not exploratory. Oops, I think you should discover the rest for yourselves. Good luck on this new venture. .. It will be a life-changing experience, REALLY! "

			"Just the fact that you are leaving home, regardless of where you go, to live alone, without your parents, is a huge learning experience. It was the first time I had to literally fend for myself, and I confess that at first I made some mistakes and did silly things, which over time become less frequent and now, after more than six months away from home, I realize how much I've grown and learned from everything I´ve experienced here. Germany is a really amazing place, and the history behind each location, the food, the people, I'm increasingly amazed at everything. They say the Germans are cold, inflexible, and some really are, but there are people like that everywhere, no matter where you go, but most of them are super. Receptive, and willing to help whenever you need them. If you do not speak German well, no problem, people speak good English and some find it a little difficult and get grumpy when you ask for help, but that doesn't mean they won't help. My programme consists of executing laboratory projects, and I only accompanied two subjects that will not count when I get back because here I am immersed in another course. But anyway, the recognition on paper is nothing compared to what I'm learning, not only in academic terms, but also in my personal life. I highly recommend Germany, in fact, I recommend anywhere; I think it's a unique experience to do an exchange and the opportunity should not be missed."

			"God created the world and the Dutch created Holland” - and they did a great job. You can see everywhere their concern for quality of life, from concerts on the canals and outdoor theatres to an extensive public transport network covering the entire city and country. Living below sea level (in some places, more than 10 meters!) is no reason for the Dutch to be miserable - on the contrary, they are receptive and never miss an opportunity to party, with anyone, anywhere. In fact, international students abound in the campus and in the city - Serbs, Iranians, Chinese, Canadian, Colombian, French, whatever.

			I have some tips for anyone who chooses to come here. Pay close attention to the procedures for getting the entry and residence visas; even when the paperwork is correct, the process might take a while and you might end up losing a few days of class. Try to get a place to stay before getting there - it saves a lot of time and hassle. Finally, buy the OV-chipkaart as soon as possible; you can use it in the Netherlands for train, tram, metro and bus, and the rates are a lot lower. The Netherlands is an amazing country, way beyond the coffee shops and the Red Light District. Coming here is an unparalleled experience, living here, unforgettable."
